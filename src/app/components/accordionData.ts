      title: "What’s the Difference Between This and Other Platforms?",
      content: "Sloane is a specialised, personalised business assistant tailored specifically to the needs of the business. Unlike those general AI tools, Sloane integrates its AI with mindful productivity tools, built-in prompts, and pre-programmed experts for ease and efficiency, creating a supportive ecosystem for their business growth and well-being. It's not just AI; it's a holistic system designed to boost both your business and your well-being"

      title: "What are 'experts' and 'prompts'?",
      content: "Sloane uses 'experts' to simplify interaction and provide a more intuitive experience, while 'prompts' are still utilised, but in a more guided and less technically demanding manner compared to other AI platforms. The experts handle much of the complex prompting, making the process easier for users, even those with limited AI experience. For example, you might choose a Marketing Expert to help with a 'marketing campaign' prompt, or a Social Media Expert to brainstorm ideas for your 'passive income offering'. You could even ask the Website Copy Expert for help with 'website copy'—all within a streamlined and user-friendly interface. Sloane's pre-programmed experts and guided prompts ensure you get the focused and relevant AI support you need, without the technical complexity and done in seconds for your specific needs and business."
